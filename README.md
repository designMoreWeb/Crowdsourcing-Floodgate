Partnered with [Stevens Institute of Technology Davidson Labs.](https://www.stevens.edu/research-entrepreneurship/research-centers-labs/davidson-laboratory)

## Our Climate is Changing...
Storms are becoming stronger and rainfall more intense. Davidson Laboratory forecasts water level all over the New York/New Jersey area with more than 200 in water sensors and a high fidelity hydrodynamic model. Our aim with this project is to create a firm real-time system to alert people in Hoboken of areas being impacted by flooding. We hope to eventually take our work even further so that it can be applied anywhere.

## Our Plan
As of now we plan on implementing the majority of this project using javascript. Check out our current dependencies here:
- [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/)
- [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) ?
- [openlayers/openstreetmap](http://openlayers.org/)

## Project Breakdown:
- Create a model for taking in data points and estimating densities based on data distribution
- Create a drawing algorithm for taking data points and drawing over streets around them based on distribution
- Create front-end UI
- Create project base in Meteor
- This is a test
