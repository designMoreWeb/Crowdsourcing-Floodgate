Partnered with [Stevens Institute of Technology Davidson Labs.](https://www.stevens.edu/research-entrepreneurship/research-centers-labs/davidson-laboratory)

## Our Climate is Changing...
Storms are becoming stronger and rainfall more intense. Davidson Laboratory forecasts water level all over the New York/New Jersey area with more than 200 in water sensors and a high fidelity hydrodynamic model. Our aim with this project is to create a firm real-time system to alert people in Hoboken of areas being impacted by flooding. We hope to eventually take our work even further so that it can be applied anywhere.

## Our Plan
As of now we plan on implementing the majority of this project using javascript. Check out our current dependencies here:
- [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Express](http://expressjs.com/)
- [d3.js](https://d3js.org/)
- More to come!
