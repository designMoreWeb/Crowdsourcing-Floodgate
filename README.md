Partnered with [Stevens Institute of Technology Davidson Labs.](https://www.stevens.edu/research-entrepreneurship/research-centers-labs/davidson-laboratory)

## Intro:
Storms are becoming stronger and rainfall more intense. Davidson Laboratory forecasts water level all over the New York/New Jersey area with more than 200 in water sensors and a high fidelity hydrodynamic model. Our aim with this project is to create a firm real-time system to alert people in Hoboken of areas being impacted by flooding. We hope to eventually take our work even further so that it can be applied anywhere.
